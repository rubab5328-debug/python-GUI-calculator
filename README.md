1- Python GUI Calculator
A simple and clean calculator built with **Python (Flask)** for backend logic and **HTML + CSS** for the user interface.
This project shows how you can convert a basic Python CLI calculator into a modern web based calculator with buttons and a responsive layout.

2- Features
* Basic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
* Simple and clean UI
* Fully responsive layout
* Flask backend
* HTML and CSS front end
* Easy to understand code structure

3-Project Structure


project-folder
-app.py                  # Flask backend
-templates
     └── index.html        # Calculator UI
 -static
      └── style.css         # Calculator styling

4-How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Install Flask


pip install flask


2. Run the app


python app.py


3. Open in browser

Go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

5- How It Works

* The buttons on the UI send data to the Flask backend
* Flask processes the numbers and operation
* The result is sent back and displayed on the screen
* Only HTML and CSS are used for styling and structure
